# Assignment operators in python allow assigning value to a variable in a particular manner. 
# Each of them has been designed to address a particular situation and must be used based on the context. 
a = 10
b = 20

# =	: Equals To
# Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand	

c = a + b #assigns value of a + b into c
print(c)
 
# += Add AND	
# It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand	

c += a # equivalent to c = c + a
print(c)
 
# -= Subtract AND	
# It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand	

c -= a # equivalent to c = c - a
print(c)
 
# *= Multiply AND	
# It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand	

c *= a # equivalent to c = c * a
print(c)
 
# /= Divide AND
# It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand	

c /= a # equivalent to c = c / a
print(c)
 
# %= Modulus AND	
# It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand	

c %= a # equivalent to c = c % a
print(c)
 
# **= Exponent AND	
# Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators and assign value to the left operand	

c **= a # equivalent to c = c ** a
print(c)
 
# //= Floor Division	
# It performs floor division on operators and assign value to the left operand	

c //= a # equivalent to c = c // a
print(c)
