# A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. 
# In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing.

# Python has no command for declaring a variable.

# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

a = 2
b = 43.34
c = "Python"
d = False
e = 6+4j

# Rules for naming a variable

# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)


A = 12
A1 = 15
a6 = 5
_ = 23
_a = "Python"
name_1 = "Bhopal"

# Following Examples will generate error
# 1a = 5
# 4b = 6

# id() function
# The id() function returns the identity of any Python object. This will return an integer identification number for different objects.
# The underlying CPython implementation uses the id() function as the address of the object, in memory
