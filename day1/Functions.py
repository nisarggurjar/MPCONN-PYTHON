# A Function in Python is a piece of code which runs when it is referenced. 
# It is used to utilize the code in more than one place in a program. 
# It is also called method or procedure. 
# Python provides many inbuilt functions like print(), input(), compile(), exec(), etc. 
# but it also gives freedom to create your own functions.
