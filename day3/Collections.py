# Collections are used to hold number of data in a single unit

# Collections in python are basically container data types, namely lists, sets, tuples, dictionary. They have different characteristics based on the declaration and the usage.

# Types of Collection

# 1. String
# 2. List
# 3. Set
# 4. Tuple
# 5. Dictionary


# A string is declared in quotations, it is a collection of characters
# A list is declared in square brackets, it is mutable, stores duplicate values and elements can be accessed using indexes.
# A tuple is ordered and immutable in nature, although duplicate entries can be there inside a tuple.
# A set is unordered and declared in square brackets. It is not indexed and does not have duplicate entries as well.
# A dictionary has key value pairs and is mutable in nature. We use square brackets to declare a dictionary.
