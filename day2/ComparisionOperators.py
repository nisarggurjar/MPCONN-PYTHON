# These operators compare the values on either sides of them and decide the relation among them. 
# They are also called Relational operators or Comparision Operator.

x = 45
y = 34

# >
# Greater than: True if the left operand is greater than the right	

print(x > y)

# <
# Less than: True if the left operand is less than the right	

print(x < y)

# ==
# Equal to: True if both operands are equal	

print(x == y)

# !=
# Not equal to â€“ True if operands are not equal	

print(x != y)

# >=
# Greater than or equal to: True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right	

print(x >= y)

# <=
# Less than or equal to: True if left operand is less than or equal to the right
